Task was to renew their company site from an old-ish Drupal 8 beta version to the newly released Drupal 8 version.

We were two very new interns, without prior Drupal experience. It was quite the fun challenge, I'd say.

They were impressed and decided to hire us for the rest of the year, after our Internship period ended.
