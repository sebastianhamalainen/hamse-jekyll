<h1>Shell HelmiSimpukka</h1>

Was my first project under Druid Oy and worked in a team of 4-6 people.

I mainly did front-end related work (most notably the group offer form and lunch blocks), because I excel at that.

The site was build on Drupal 8.

Learnt a lot on this project; how to work in a team, the BEM methology and to work with a customer.
