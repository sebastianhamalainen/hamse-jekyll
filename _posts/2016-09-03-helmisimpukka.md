Was my first real project at Druid Oy and worked it in a team of 4-6 people.

I mainly did front-end related work, because I love to make thing pretty and I excel at it.

The site is build on Drupal 8.

Learnt a lot on this project; how to work in a team, the BEM methology and to work with a customer.
